# tuido, a ‚úîÔ∏è todo app written in Go üî∑

## How to use

tuido is very minimalistic. When you start the application, you will be faced with some options
adding todos, toggling todos, deleting todos, and quitting the application

### Adding
To add a task, type `a`, then you will be prompted to enter the content of your task

### Toggling
Toggling is simply "doing" or "undoing" the task. You simply just select the task you want to toggle, and type `t`.

### Deleting
Deleting tasks is similar to toggling, where you have to select the item you are going to delete.

### Quitting
Quitting is very simple. You just type `q`, and now are not running the application!
